Ideally, that would include a small sample project that reproduces the problem.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

we've had a time to fix it.

## Sign the Contributor License Agreement

Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to read the Contributor License Agreement.

## Code Conventions and Housekeeping

None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.

They can also be added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* We use the [Spring JavaFormat](https://github.com/spring-io/spring-javaformat/) project to apply code formatting conventions.
  You can install the [Spring JavaFormat IntelliJ Plugin](https://github.com/spring-io/spring-javaformat/#intellij-idea) or format the code from the Maven build by running `mvn validate`.
* The build includes Spring JavaFormat rules for many of our code conventions. Run `mvn validate` if you want to check your changes are compliant.
* Make sure all new `.java` files have a Javadoc class comment with at least an `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is for.
* Add the Apache license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files in the project).
* Add yourself as an `@author` to the `.java` files that you modify substantially (more than cosmetic changes).
* Add some Javadocs.
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
* Verification tasks, including tests and formatting checks, can be executed by running `mvn check` from the project root directory.
* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current main branch (or other target branch in the project).
* When writing a commit message please follow [these conventions](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

## Building

```bash
# Full build (validates formatting, runs tests)
mvn clean install

# Faster build (skip tests and javadoc)
mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true

# Validate formatting only
mvn validate
```
